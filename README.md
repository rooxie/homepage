# About
This is my personal website which I'm using to show my bio on the web and as a showcase platform for my projects.

It is heavily inspired by [Ubuntu](https://design.ubuntu.com/) Linux distro graphic interface.

Technologies  used:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework
- [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) Bootstrap integration for React

## Usage

Available scripts from `create-react-app`:
- `yarn start`
- `yarn test`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn eject`
